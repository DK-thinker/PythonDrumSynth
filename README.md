Simple 16-step sequencer with (hopefully) real time sound synthesis. Main library will be pyAudio for all the port audio in and out stuff. 
All sounds will have a few macro parameters that can be modified by the user.
Plan-b in case realtime synthesis is too slow, would be uploading samples and then the app would just play the samples.

As of 4-10:
Got the oscillator, envelope and drum synth classes working. Now it is time to build up GUI screens, sequence creation, playback, and buffering!
